I am Aiko.

Software engineer, Consultant, Keynote speaker.

Like many others before I now have my own website, or “Homepage” as we used to say in the 2000s.

So far there’s nothing really to see, but I’ll be publishing new blog posts and other things I am working on here. I’ll also be migrating old posts and talk recordings etc. to this site.

Admittedly, this is also a tiny bit about me just finally building my own website. 🤓
