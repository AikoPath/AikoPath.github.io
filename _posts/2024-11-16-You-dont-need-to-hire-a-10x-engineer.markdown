Finally, after years of contractually required abstinence from public speaking, my new talk is out.

Abstract:
> This talk discusses how a good developer experience (design system, scaffolding tools, tech standards, ...), combined with the right organisational structures and operating model, a lean team composition with a focus on autonomy, and an organisation that measures individual impact can lead to high performing teams with exceptional productivity.
