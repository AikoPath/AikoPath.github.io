Abstract:
> Not another one of these * Driven Development, you say? This one is different, I promise!
>
> Writing good Software is difficult! It is mentally exhausting! Programmers need to make decisions all the time: Should I write a comment here? Does this function belong to another class? What should the test name be?
>
>In this talk I propose a mindset that let’s you make better, more reasonable decisions more easily. I’ll be using examples from daily development life situations that show the effectiveness of Consumer Driven Software Development and by itself are already worth applying.
>
>TL;DR: Write better software more easily with this easy trick! Software development coaches hate him!
