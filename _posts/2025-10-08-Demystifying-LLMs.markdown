Abstract:
> Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini are reshaping how people in every field approach problem-solving, from brainstorming ideas to debugging complex systems. This talk will explain, in straightforward terms, how LLMs work, what they’re good at, and where their boundaries lie.
We’ll explore the principles of prompt engineering—how to frame questions and instructions to get clearer, more reliable results—and show practical ways to make LLMs a valuable part of everyday work. Attendees will leave with a grounded understanding of how to think about LLMs and concrete strategies for using them effectively in their own workflows.
