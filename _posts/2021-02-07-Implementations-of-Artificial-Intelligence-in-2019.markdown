Check out there websites or read the quote here:
> 2018 can easily be called the ‘Year of the Chatbot’. While most chatbots have been rudimentary FAQ replacements, we should start seeing further influences of natural language processing that will propel the chatbot evolution to further ‘seamless interactive’ heights. Now, broadening that overview, one can comfortably say that AI has matured quite quickly over the last few years and is easier to implement now, than ever before – thanks to computing and storage access, connected systems and the data deluge. For instance, 2019 will definitely see aggressive AI implementation in fields like healthcare and retail where extensive groundwork has been carried out over the recent past. Looking inward, AI, as the child of IT is an inherent part of the industry and will increasingly drive more aspects of the software development life cycle like application testing and cybersecurity, says Aiko Klostermann, Technology Consultant, ThoughtWorks.
