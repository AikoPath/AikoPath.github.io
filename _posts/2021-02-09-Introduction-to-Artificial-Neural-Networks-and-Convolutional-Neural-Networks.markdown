> If you follow the news in the field of technology, you will come across Artificial Neural Networks eventually, often times in relation to what was thought to be impossible just a decade ago.
>
>  These networks recognize patterns in big data, beat Go champions, understand the meaning of spoken language and much more.
>
>  But what do they look like and how do they actually work?! Is it black magic? (Spoiler: it’s not.)
>
>  This talk will give insight into the structure of these networks and will try to explain what’s going on inside them and how they can perform all these tasks.
>
>  In recent years Convolutional Neural Networks, a special type of Neural Network that is considered a deep learning network, got a lot of attention due to their remarkable results in the field of object classification and recognition. They are used in many services that we come across on a daily basis.
>
>  The differences of Convolutional Neural Networks compared to general Neural Networks is explained, as well as the reasons why they perform so well when it comes to image data.
>
>  This talk is an introduction to explain the basics of artificial neural networks, no previous knowledge is required.
>
>  Agenda:
>
>  6.30 pm: Welcome and drinks
>
>  7.00 pm: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks by Aiko Klostermann
>
>  8:15 pm: Q&A
>
>  8:45 pm: Drinks and networking


This talk was presented publicly at a meetup in Hamburg. There is a recording of it somewhere on some sd card in some box, I'll upload the recording if I find it.
For now: here are the slides.
