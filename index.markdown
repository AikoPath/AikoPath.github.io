Like many others before I now have my own website, or "Homepage" as we used to say in the 2000s.

So far there's nothing to see really, but I'll be publishing new blog posts and other things I am working on here.
I'll also be migrating old posts and talk recordings etc. to this site. 

Admittedly, this is also a tiny bit about me finally building my own website. ðŸ¤“
